A Flutter application demonstrating a clean and scalable approach to working with GraphQL APIs.

Overview

This project shows how to build a Flutter app that interacts with a GraphQL backend using a structured architecture.
It brings together several tools to create a reliable development setup:

GraphQL Flutter — Handles queries, mutations, and subscriptions with a type-safe, declarative API.

Dio — Wrapped around the GraphQL client to provide improved error handling, interceptors, and network logging.

Flutter BLoC — Used as the state management layer to keep UI updates predictable and easy to test.

These tools work together to demonstrate a practical pattern you can use in real projects.

Pubspec Plugins Used

Below are the key dependencies included in this project:

graphql_flutter – Core library for making GraphQL requests in Flutter.

dio – HTTP client used for custom error handling and request configuration.

flutter_bloc – State management using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern.

json_annotation / json_serializable / build_runner – Used for generating model classes and handling JSON mapping cleanly.

(If you have more dependencies, you can list them here following the same pattern.)
